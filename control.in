Description: Can you handle the difficulties of turning?
    Your job is to carve a given shape out of wood with a chisel. The better 
    you match the shape and more accure job you do, the better score you 
    will get. With earned score you can buy new faster and stronger chisels. 
    Watch out for going too fast, as you might overheat your chisel or break 
    the wood!
